# CS 340 IHear Assignment 6: Hello Plus

* This is a program using React to display Hello World! in a web browser!

## How To Run
  The best & easiest way to run this program is to follow [this tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/reactjs-tutorial#:~:text=Hello%20World,-Let's%20update%20the&text=Create%20a%20component%20inside%20index,render%20with%20.&text=Once%20you%20save%20the%20index,ll%20see%20%22Hello%20World!%22)
  
  If done correctly, you should see a white browser screen with the text, Hello World! displayed. If you want to display anything else, you can edit the Hello World! text in the index.js file to anything you want. Save the file and the browser should update with your changed text.
