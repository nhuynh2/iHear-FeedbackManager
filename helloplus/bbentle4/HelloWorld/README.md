# Hello World Plus
### Brenna Bentley - bbentle4 

## How to Run
I used Expo to lay the foundation of the app.
I added features to index.tsx (Homepage) I think we'll use in the app such as
- list
- add item to list (though I am having an error with this)


Environment - MacOS Sonoma 14.6.1 

1. Install dependencies
   - Node.js
   - npm
2. Navigate to iHear/helloplus/bbentle4/HelloWorld
3. `npm run` in your terminal will give you options
   I recommend `npm run web` as this will allow you to see it your web browser and a QR code will appear. If you have Expo Go downloaded on your phone, you can use your phone camera to view the app on your phone as well. 

## How React Native will be used in this project 
React will be used to create the user interface for both iOS and Android for both the "user" (those making the complaints) and the staff/managers.
