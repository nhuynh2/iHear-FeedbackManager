# Hello World Plus
### Brenna Bentley - bbentle4 

## How to Run
I used Expo to lay the foundation of the app. 

1. Install dependencies
   - Node.js
   - npm
2. Navigate to iHear/helloplus/bbentle4/HelloWorld
3. `npm run` in your terminal will give you options
   I recommend `npm run web` as this will allow you to see it your web browser and a QR code will appear. If you have Expo Go downloaded on your phone, you can use your phone camera to view the app on your phone as well.
