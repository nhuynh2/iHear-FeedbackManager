## What I accomplished

- I took me a half of a day to design, get feedback, and finalized the app logo. We went through 4 versions in total, and decided to keep the last one.
- The back-end Authentication took me a quite long time to complete:

  - The first step is try to get the key file to connect to Firebase. This step cost a half of the time because it took really long to build React Native app for each run time.
  - Next, I created a local project to learn and practice the back-end code for Authentication.
  - Then, I have to figure out how to apply that Authentication to our working project.
  - The next step is to style the front-end of the Index tab (mainly for sign-in).

- I also play the role of Team Leader, who:
  - Design the primary structure of the app.
  - Draw my design so others can understand.
  - Assigning tasks for others.
  - Code pair-reviewing through Discord.
  - Combine other front-end tabs into a completed app.
  - Run and ensure compability on both iOS and Android.
