# Sprint 1

## Info
- Name: Leon Hoang (Phu Hoang)
- GithubID: PhuHoang177
- Group name: iHear

## What I planned to do
- Research and select the most suitable Framework
- Design the app logo
- Code a front-end screen: One dashboard tab for all Roles
- Connect the app to our database (Firebase)
- Write document to help other members build and run the app

## What I did not complete
- Connect the app to our database (Firebase): I actually did it, but my workload was enough so I helped other member complete it

## What issue I worked on
- #2: Research and select a suitable Framework
- #3: Design app logo
- #4: Front-end: Dashboard tab for all roles

## Files that I worked on
- Research framework: the entire directory and its contents: *iHear/projects/researches*
- Design app logo: 4 versions:
- - *iHear/projects/iHear/assets/images/iHear-1.png*
- - *iHear/projects/iHear/assets/images/iHear-2.png*
- - *iHear/projects/iHear/assets/images/iHear-3.png*
- - *iHear/projects/iHear/assets/images/iHear-4.png*
- Front-end: Dashboard tab for all roles: 
- - *iHear/projects/iHear/app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx*
- A make-up json file to test reading data:
- - *iHear/projects/iHear/assets/data/tickets.json*

## What I accomplished
### Research and select the most suitable Framework
- There are 4 types of framework (build method to be exactly) in the *iHear/projects/researches*:
- - sand-box: This is the a plug-and-play app for beginner to get used to Expo React Native. It is convenient but has many limitation, one of them is missing some core libraries such as Firebase connection, Notification pushing... Therefore, we cannot use this build for our project.
