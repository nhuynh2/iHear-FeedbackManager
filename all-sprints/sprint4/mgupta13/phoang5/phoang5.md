## What I accomplished

- I did 95% of the workload on this sprint-4 (14 tasks, 10 of them are database and back-end )
- Some tasks are really time-consuming: Database configuration, Search_and_Select function, Uploading and Downloading from database...
- I discuss with Jasmine (Ngan Huynh) to design our database
- I wrote many issues (tasks) to assign for teammate
- I reconstruct front-end of the Report page to make it fit with our database and look professional
- I review code of the Pull Requests: [PR](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/iHear/pull/84)
