What Went Well:
  * Project as a whole -> feel like the project as a whole is coming together and looking nice
  * Contributions -> I am happy with my contributions and effort on this project, I am happy with how my pages look and that it runs properly on the Android as well
  * I am happy that the testing for this sprint went well. There wasn't any major errors or anything so it is looking good for the final presentation so far

What Could be Improved:
  * Communication could always get better as a team
  * All being on the same page about certain aspects of the project
  * My time management/prioritization skills could be better -> these past weeks have been really busy, heavy, and stressful

Feedback:
  I feel like things over the course of the semester worked pretty well for our group. We all did our part and contributions to the project and it is turning out well.
  I was able to get much needed help when I needed to for certain sprints and the chemistry between us grew as the semester chugged along. We helped each other and worked well together I think.
  There was some difficulty in times, either language barriers, or miscommunication, or lots of stress but overall I think this semester was good. 

  Improved in Future Classes:
    I don't have much for improvement for future classes really. I think the system and the way it is now is pretty good. If I did have one suggestion it would be that
    when picking a topic for the project, it doesn't necessarily have to be a problem. To my understanding, the project had to be fixing or addressing some type of problem/issue
    so instead of that, make it more general and allow students to pick anything even if it doesn't solve an issue. I may be wrong on this, i am not sure but this is my feedback for the class. 
    For example, I liked the idea of creating some sort of game or just informational website, neither solve an issue but are cool projects I would have liked to do.
